# 📘 Day 15

## Python Error Types

When we write code it is common that we make a typo or some other common error. If our code fails to run, the Python interpreter will display a message, containing feedback with information on where the problem occurs and the type of an error. It will also sometimes gives us suggestions on a possible fix. Understanding different types of errors in programming languages will help us to debug our code quickly and also it makes us better at what we do.

Let us see the most common error types one by one. First let us open our Python interactive shell. Go to your you computer terminal and write 'python'. The python interactive shell will be opened.

### SyntaxError

**Example 1: SyntaxError**

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print 'hello world'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print 'hello world'
                      ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello world')?
>>>
```

As you can see we made a syntax error because we forgot to enclose the string with parenthesis and Python already suggests the solution. Let us fix it.

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print 'hello world'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print 'hello world'
                      ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello world')?
>>> print('hello world')
hello world
>>>
```

The error was a _SyntaxError_. After the fix our code was executed without a hitch. Let see more error types.

### NameError

**Example 1: NameError**

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print(age)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'age' is not defined
>>>
```

As you can see from the message above, name age is not defined. Yes, it is true that we did not define an age variable but we were trying to print it out as if we had had declared it. Now, lets fix this by declaring it and assigning with a value.

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print(age)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'age' is not defined
>>> age = 25
>>> print(age)
25
>>>
```

The type of error was a _NameError_. We debugged the error by defining the variable name.

### IndexError

**Example 1: IndexError**

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> numbers[5]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
>>>
```

In the example above, Python raised an _IndexError_, because the list has only indexes from 0 to 4 , so it was out of range.

### ModuleNotFoundError

**Example 1: ModuleNotFoundError**

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import maths
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'
>>>
```

In the example above, I added an extra s to math deliberately and _ModuleNotFoundError_ was raised. Lets fix it by removing the extra s from math.

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import maths
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'
>>> import math
>>>
```

We fixed it, so let's use some of the functions from the math module.

### AttributeError

**Example 1: AttributeError**

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import maths
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'
>>> import math
>>> math.PI
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: module 'math' has no attribute 'PI'
>>>
```

As you can see, I made a mistake again! Instead of pi, I tried to call a PI function from maths module. It raised an attribute error, it means, that the function does not exist in the module. Lets fix it by changing from PI to pi.

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import maths
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'
>>> import math
>>> math.PI
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: module 'math' has no attribute 'PI'
>>> math.pi
3.141592653589793
>>>
```

Now, when we call pi from the math module we got the result.

### KeyError

**Example 1: KeyError**

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> users = {'name':'Asab', 'age':250, 'country':'Finland'}
>>> users['name']
'Asab'
>>> users['county']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'county'
>>>
```

As you can see, there was a typo in the key used to get the dictionary value. so, this is a key error and the fix is quite straight forward. Let's do this!

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> user = {'name':'Asab', 'age':250, 'country':'Finland'}
>>> user['name']
'Asab'
>>> user['county']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'county'
>>> user['country']
'Finland'
>>>
```

We debugged the error, our code ran and we got the value.

### TypeError

**Example 1: TypeError**

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 4 + '3'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
>>>
```

In the example above, a TypeError is raised because we cannot add a number to a string. First solution would be to convert the string to int or float. Another solution would be converting the number to a string (the result then would be '43'). Let us follow the first fix.

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 4 + '3'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
>>> 4 + int('3')
7
>>> 4 + float('3')
7.0
>>>
```

Error removed and we got the result we expected.

### ImportError

**Example 1: TypeError**

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from math import power
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name 'power' from 'math'
>>>
```

There is no function called power in the math module, it goes with a different name: _pow_. Let's correct it:

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from math import power
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name 'power' from 'math'
>>> from math import pow
>>> pow(2,3)
8.0
>>>
```

### ValueError

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> int('12a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12a'
>>>
```

In this case we cannot change the given string to a number, because of the 'a' letter in it.

### ZeroDivisionError

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 1/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
>>>
```

We cannot divide a number by zero.

We have covered some of the python error types, if you want to check more about it check the python documentation about python error types.
If you are good at reading the error types then you will be able to fix your bugs fast and you will also become a better programmer.

🌕 You are excelling. You made it to half way to your way to greatness. Now do some exercises for your brain and for your muscle.

## 💻 Python Type Errors Exercises

1. Open you python interactive shell and try all the examples covered in this section.




## Exception Handling

Python uses _try_ and _except_ to handle errors gracefully. A graceful exit (or graceful handling) of errors is a simple programming idiom - a program detects a serious error condition and "exits gracefully", in a controlled manner as a result. Often the program prints a descriptive error message to a terminal or log as part of the graceful exit, this makes our application more robust. The cause of an exception is often external to the program itself. An example of exceptions could be an incorrect input, wrong file name, unable to find a file, a malfunctioning IO device. Graceful handling of errors prevents our applications from crashing.

We have covered the different Python _error_ types in the previous section. If we use _try_ and _except_ in our program, then it will not raise errors in those blocks.

![Try and Except](../images/try_except.png)

```py
try:
    code in this block if things go well
except:
    code in this block run if things go wrong
```

**Example:**

```py
try:
    print(10 + '5')
except:
    print('Something went wrong')
```

In the example above the second operand is a string. We could change it to float or int to add it with the number to make it work. But without any changes, the second block, _except_, will be executed.

**Example:**

```py
try:
    name = input('Enter your name:')
    year_born = input('Year you were born:')
    age = 2019 - year_born
    print(f'You are {name}. And your age is {age}.')
except:
    print('Something went wrong')
```

```sh
Something went wrong
```

In the above example, the exception block will run and we do not know exactly the problem. To analyze the problem, we can use the different error types with except.

In the following example, it will handle the error and will also tell us the kind of error raised.

```py
try:
    name = input('Enter your name:')
    year_born = input('Year you were born:')
    age = 2019 - year_born
    print(f'You are {name}. And your age is {age}.')
except TypeError:
    print('Type error occured')
except ValueError:
    print('Value error occured')
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print('zero division error occured')
```

```sh
Enter your name:Asabeneh
Year you born:1920
Type error occured
```

In the code above the output is going to be _TypeError_.
Now, let's add an additional block:

```py
try:
    name = input('Enter your name:')
    year_born = input('Year you born:')
    age = 2019 - int(year_born)
    print(f'You are {name}. And your age is {age}.')
except TypeError:
    print('Type error occur')
except ValueError:
    print('Value error occur')
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print('zero division error occur')
else:
    print('I usually run with the try block')
finally:
    print('I alway run.')
```

```sh
Enter your name:Asabeneh
Year you born:1920
You are Asabeneh. And your age is 99.
I usually run with the try block
I alway run.
```

It is also shorten the above code as follows:

```py
try:
    name = input('Enter your name:')
    year_born = input('Year you born:')
    age = 2019 - int(year_born)
    print(f'You are {name}. And your age is {age}.')
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

```

## Packing and Unpacking Arguments in Python

We use two operators:

- \* for tuples
- \*\* for dictionaries

Let us take as an example below. It takes only arguments but we have list. We can unpack the list and changes to argument.

### Unpacking

#### Unpacking Lists

```py
def sum_of_five_nums(a, b, c, d, e):
    return a + b + c + d + e

lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_of_five_nums(lst)) # TypeError: sum_of_five_nums() missing 4 required positional arguments: 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'
```

When we run the this code, it raises an error, because this function takes numbers (not a list) as arguments. Let us unpack/destructure the list.

```py
def sum_of_five_nums(a, b, c, d, e):
    return a + b + c + d + e

lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_of_five_nums(*lst))  # 15
```

We can also use unpacking in the range built-in function that expects a start and an end.

```py
numbers = range(2, 7)  # normal call with separate arguments
print(list(numbers)) # [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
args = [2, 7]
numbers = range(*args)  # call with arguments unpacked from a list
print(numbers)      # [2, 3, 4, 5,6]

```

A list or a tuple can also be unpacked like this:

```py
countries = ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark', 'Iceland']
fin, sw, nor, *rest = countries
print(fin, sw, nor, rest)   # Finland Sweden Norway ['Denmark', 'Iceland']
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
one, *middle, last = numbers
print(one, middle, last)      #  1 [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 7
```

#### Unpacking Dictionaries

```py
def unpacking_person_info(name, country, city, age):
    return f'{name} lives in {country}, {city}. He is {age} year old.'
dct = {'name':'Asabeneh', 'country':'Finland', 'city':'Helsinki', 'age':250}
print(unpacking_person_info(**dct)) # Asabeneh lives in Finland, Helsinki. He is 250 years old.
```

### Packing

Sometimes we never know how many arguments need to be passed to a python function. We can use the packing method to allow our function to take unlimited number or arbitrary number of arguments.

### Packing Lists

```py
def sum_all(*args):
    s = 0
    for i in args:
        s += i
    return s
print(sum_all(1, 2, 3))             # 6
print(sum_all(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)) # 28
```

#### Packing Dictionaries

```py
def packing_person_info(**kwargs):
    # check the type of kwargs and it is a dict type
    # print(type(kwargs))
    # Printing dictionary items
    for key in kwargs:
        print(f"{key} = {kwargs[key]}")
    return kwargs

print(packing_person_info(name="Asabeneh",
      country="Finland", city="Helsinki", age=250))
```

```sh
name = Asabeneh
country = Finland
city = Helsinki
age = 250
{'name': 'Asabeneh', 'country': 'Finland', 'city': 'Helsinki', 'age': 250}
```

## Spreading in Python

Like in JavaScript, spreading is possible in Python. Let us check it in an example below:

```py
lst_one = [1, 2, 3]
lst_two = [4, 5, 6, 7]
lst = [0, *lst_one, *lst_two]
print(lst)          # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
country_lst_one = ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Norway']
country_lst_two = ['Denmark', 'Iceland']
nordic_countries = [*country_lst_one, *country_lst_two]
print(nordic_countries)  # ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark', 'Iceland']
```

## Enumerate

If we are interested in an index of a list, we use _enumerate_ built-in function to get the index of each item in the list.

```py
for index, item in enumerate([20, 30, 40]):
    print(index, item)
```

```py
for index, i in enumerate(countries):
    print('hi')
    if i == 'Finland':
        print('The country {i} has been found at index {index}')
```

```sh
The country Finland has been found at index 1.
```

## Zip

Sometimes we would like to combine lists when looping through them. See the example below:

```py
fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon', 'lime']                    
vegetables = ['Tomato', 'Potato', 'Cabbage','Onion', 'Carrot']
fruits_and_veges = []
for f, v in zip(fruits, vegetables):
    fruits_and_veges.append({'fruit':f, 'veg':v})

print(fruits_and_veges)
```

```sh
[{'fruit': 'banana', 'veg': 'Tomato'}, {'fruit': 'orange', 'veg': 'Potato'}, {'fruit': 'mango', 'veg': 'Cabbage'}, {'fruit': 'lemon', 'veg': 'Onion'}, {'fruit': 'lime', 'veg': 'Carrot'}]
```

🌕 You are determined. You are 17 steps a head to your way to greatness. Now do some exercises for your brain and muscles.

## Exception Handling/ Packing Unpacking Exercises:

1. names = ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Norway','Denmark','Iceland', 'Estonia','Russia']. Unpack the first five countries and store them in a variable nordic_countries, store Estonia and Russia in es, and ru respectively.
